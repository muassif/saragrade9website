          <h2>Leading Lines</h2>
          <p>Leading lines are a powerful compositional tool in photography that guide the viewer's gaze and create a sense of depth and movement within an image. They are lines or shapes that direct the viewer's attention towards a specific subject or point of interest.</p>

      <li>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Rule of Thirds</h2>
          <p>The rule of thirds divides the image into nine equal parts. It is used for a more visually appealing and balanced composition. It suggests that the subject and focus point of the image should be in one of the nine equal sections.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Shadows</h2>
          <p>Shadows in photography are created when an object blocks or partially blocks the path of light, resulting in an area of darkness cast on a surface. Shadows play a crucial role in composition, adding depth, dimension, and visual interest to an image.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Contrast</h2>
          <p>Contrast in photography refers to the difference in brightness, colors, or tones between different elements within an image. It is a fundamental element that adds visual impact, depth, and emphasis to a photograph.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Depth of Field</h2>
          <p>Depth of field in photography refers to the range of distance within an image that appears sharp and in focus. It is determined by the aperture setting, the focal length of the lens, and the distance between the camera and the subject.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <div class="content">
          <h2>Filling the Frame</h2>
          <p>Filling the frame in photography refers to the technique of capturing a subject or scene that it occupies a significant portion or the entirety of the image frame. The photographer eliminates distracting or unnecessary elements, which focus the attention on a subject.</p>

  <h3 id="last-heading">Combining Techniques</h3>
  <p id="last-text">When experimenting with all these techniques, it is important to note to try combining them. It creates a visual interest for the viewers allowing them to have more meaning when analysing the photograph. In some images, combining the techniques allow more of a story to talk about. However, it is vital to note to not use too many. In most cases photographers can fail to make a successful composition as when using these techniques they combine too many causing it to create confusion and a cluster in the singular image. Your photographs should be clear and construct. For instance, try experimenting with depth of field with rule of thirds to have more focus on the subject.  </p>
